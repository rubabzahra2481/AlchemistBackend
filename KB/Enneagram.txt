    "Enneagram Overview:",
    "Type 1 – The Reformer / Perfectionist: motivated by a need to be right and avoid mistakes; fears being wrong or bad.",
    "Type 2 – The Helper / Giver: motivated by a need to be loved and appreciated; fears being unwanted or unworthy of love.",
    "Type 3 – The Achiever / Performer: motivated by a need to succeed and be admired; fears failure or being seen as worthless.",
    "Type 4 – The Individualist / Romantic: motivated by a need to be unique and authentic; fears being ordinary or misunderstood.",
    "Type 5 – The Investigator / Observer: motivated by a need to understand and protect personal energy; fears incompetence or being invaded.",
    "Type 6 – The Loyalist / Guardian: motivated by a need for safety and support; fears uncertainty, betrayal, or being without guidance.",
    "Type 7 – The Enthusiast / Adventurer: motivated by a need for freedom and happiness; fears pain, restriction, or boredom.",
    "Type 8 – The Challenger / Protector: motivated by a need for control and independence; fears being weak or controlled by others.",
